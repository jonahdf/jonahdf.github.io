I"³<p>Unfortunately, the Google Map didnâ€™t work for this day, as I had no service in Yellowstone. We drove from Yellowstone to somewhere random in the middle of Wyoming, near the SD border, and probably around 300 miles.</p>

<p>9/16/20:</p>

<p>To be honest, there is not too much to share from this day besides the photos, but here is my verdict on Yellowstone; Absolutely amazing geothermal features, but ridiculously crowded to the point that it detracted from the experience (especially during a pandemic). The walkways were completely jammed, making it impossible to stay safely distant from people, and mask wearing wasnâ€™t amazing. We loved the scenery, but decided to just leave once we saw the coolest areas. Here are some photos.</p>
