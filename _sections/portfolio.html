<p>In 2020, I built an interactive synthesizer and sequencer using Elm. It features
many scales, separate keyboard/sequencer input, saving and loading files, and customizable
BPM, length, and synth types. I really enjoyed making this, and still often play around with
it for fun! Check it out.</p>

<p> During the summer of 2020, I interned for the Bohdan Khomtchouk lab at UChicago, where I designed an application to visualize force-directed
  networks in augmented reality on mobile devices. While the project is not open source yet, here is an early visualization. Release and paper coming soon. </p>
