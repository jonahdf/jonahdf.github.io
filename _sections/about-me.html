<p>I am a 3rd year student at the University of Chicago, studying computer science and music.
    In my free time, I enjoy learning about natural sciences and exploring the outdoors. Here's a photo of me at the Colorado national monument.
Stopped by here on my drive back to SF after spring classes were cancelled. </p>
