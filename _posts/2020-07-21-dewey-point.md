It has been a long and sedentary quarantine, and I have been greatly missing my rock climbing adventures of last winter and summer.
I have been interested in backpacking in a very long time, and since I'm not currently quarantining with anyone who rock climbs,
it is the most adventurous outdoor activity that I can actually do. For my first ever trip, I decided to head to one of my favorite
places, Yosemite National Park. The permiting system was easier than I expected: choose a trailhead, make sure it's not reserved for
your date, and fill out a simple form. I opted for the McGurk meadows trailhead, and planned to hike to and camp at Dewey Point with Mia.

On Wednesday, we got up early and drove out to the park. I decided to head through the south entrance, as I wanted to check out the giant
sequoias of the Mariposa grove and show Mia the full experience of tunnel view.

not necessarily worth the walk given limited time to explore Yosemite"%}

one of the best pictures of us from our entire relationship!" %}

Then, we decided to check out lower Yosemite falls. With a low water season, not as spectacular as always, but still beautiful nonetheless!

On the way back to the car, we were delighted to spot a wild black bear munching on some berries!

It was a successful first day. The next morning we set off to the McGurk Meadows trailhead. After a few miles, we arrived
at the meadow.

A few more brutal miles uphill, and our breaths were taken away by the panoramic view of Dewey Point. What a wonderful place to camp.

The next day, we decided to head back on the Pohono trail towards Taft point, to see more panoramic views and the fissures. We also stopped for a 
(not-so-quick) dip in this river. Incredibly cold but certainly refreshing.

Instead of camping for another night, we opted to just head back to the car. After we realized we burned over 2000 calories that day from hiking, we
stopped on the way home for a giant In-n-out meal. Double-double, animal fries, AND a shake! Guess I should hike more often...
