Unfortunately, the Google Map didn't work for this day, as I had no service in Yellowstone. We drove from Yellowstone to somewhere random in the middle of Wyoming, near the SD border, and probably around 300 miles.

To be honest, there is not too much to share from this day besides the photos, but here is my verdict on Yellowstone; Absolutely amazing geothermal features, but ridiculously crowded to the point that it detracted from the experience (especially during a pandemic). The walkways were completely jammed, making it impossible to stay safely distant from people, and mask wearing wasn't amazing. We loved the scenery, but decided to just leave once we saw the coolest areas. Here are some photos.
